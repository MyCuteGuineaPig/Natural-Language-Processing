Tropical Storm Epsilon has been upgraded to a hurricane , a record 14th for this year .
Forecasters said Friday that Epsilon is east of Bermuda and is not expected to hit land .
The six-month hurricane season officially ended November 30 , the busiest period on record .
With 26 named storms , forecasters used up their list of designated names and resorted to marking the storms with letters of the Greek alphabet .
The season was also unusually intense .
Three hurricanes briefly reached the most violent Category Five status , with Katrina devastating New Orleans and other parts of the U.S. Gulf coast .
Some experts believe the intensity marks the beginning of a cycle expected to last more than a decade .

Federal officials say up to one million people , mostly from New Orleans , have been displaced in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
More than 2,00,000 victims have taken refuge in nearby Texas , while others are scattered in cities and towns from California to New York City .
War , economic disaster , religious and social persecution and natural catastrophes have forced large populations to relocate many times in American history .
Experts say this time , however , the migration of hundreds of thousands from New Orleans and the U.S. Gulf Coast is completely different - as the newly homeless are coming from one of America 's most unique and diverse cities , and it is happening over a much shorter period of time .

The U.S. military has drafted a document that calls for nuclear strikes against nations or terrorist groups to prevent them from using weapons of mass destruction against the United States or its allies .
The document ( " Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations " ) was drafted in March .
It updates a 1995 version from the Clinton administration to reflect President Bush 's doctrine of pre-emptive military strikes against nations or groups posing a threat to the United States .
The document outlines a number of scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons , which would require the approval of the president .

A team of Dutch researchers says vaccinating chickens against bird flu can prevent a major outbreak of the disease by preventing transmission from bird to bird .
The finding was published in the American scientific journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Scientist Jeanet Van der Goot said the study showed vaccination reduced the infectiousness of chickens with avian flu as well as reducing the susceptibility of healthy chickens .
The study concludes that vaccination can be an attractive tool to prevent outbreaks of bird flu in poultry , thereby eliminating a source of human infections .
The Dutch study was conducted using a strain of the virus different from the H5N1 strain that has caused human fatalities .
The study says it takes about two weeks from the date of inoculation for a vaccine to protect a flock .

Tunisia has a diverse economy , with important agricultural , mining , tourism , and manufacturing sectors .
Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization , simplification of the tax structure , and a prudent approach to debt .
Progressive social policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia relative to the region .
Real growth , which averaged almost 5 % over the past decade , declined to 4.6 % in 2008 and to 03-Apr % in 2009 - 10 because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in Europe - Tunisia 's largest export market .
However , development of non-textile manufacturing , a recovery in agricultural production , and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the economic effect of slowing exports .
Tunisia will need to reach even higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing population of university graduates .
The challenges ahead include : privatizing industry , liberalizing the investment code to increase foreign investment , improving government efficiency , reducing the trade deficit , and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the impoverished south and west .

They also said traders are concerned that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might cut production quotas further at a meeting next month .
The declining value of the U.S. dollar also played a role in boosting prices because international oil transactions are generally priced in dollars .

The hearing before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming convened Tuesday as gasoline prices hit an average price of 86 cents a liter ( $ 3.29 a gallon ) across the United States .
The top companies together cleared $ 123 billion in profits last year , with Exxon reaping about one-third of that .
Majority Democrats asked why such profitable companies need $ 18 billion in tax breaks , and why they do not invest more money in renewable energy sources , such as wind or solar .
The executives say their profits are reasonable considering the huge size of their companies .
They also argue that ending tax breaks will just make soaring oil costs hit consumers even harder .

Montevideo , founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold , soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important commercial center .
Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821 , Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle .
The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century established widespread political , social , and economic reforms that established a statist tradition .
A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros , launched in the late 1960s , led Uruguay 's president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973 .

The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid , the Palestinian Authority 's ( PA ) implementation of economic and security reforms , and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the Israeli Government .
Nevertheless , overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 .
The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows , industrial capacity , and basic commerce , both external and internal .
Since 2008 , the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance , supported by more than $ 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the PA 's budget since 2007 .
An easing of some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities .
The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West Bank remain Palestinians ' lack of access to land and resources in Israeli-controlled areas , import and export restrictions , and a high-cost capital structure .
Absent robust private sector growth , the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs .
The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean , but larger than the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean ) .

Strategically important , Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830 .
In a referendum held in 1967 , Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency .
The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links .
A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar .
In response to these talks , the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain .
Since late 2004 , tripartite talks among Spain , the UK , and Gibraltar have been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population , and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services ; communications and maritime security ; policy , legal and customs services ; environmental protection ; and education and visa services .
Throughout 2009 , a dispute over Gibraltar 's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols .
A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007 , and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar 's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008 , but the UK retains responsibility for defense , foreign relations , internal security , and financial stability .

Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979 .
Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s .
After losing free and fair elections in 1990 , 1996 , and 2001 , former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 .
The 2008 municipal elections were marred by widespread irregularities .
Nicaragua 's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt , but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration .
With a well-developed infrastructure , a free-enterprise economy , generally pro-investment policies , and strong export industries , Thailand enjoyed solid growth from 2000 to 2007 - averaging more than 4 % per year - as it recovered from the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 .
Thai exports - mostly machinery and electronic components , agricultural commodities , and jewelry - continue to drive the economy , accounting for more than half of GDP .

In 2009 , the economy contracted 2.2 % .
In 2010 , Thailand 's economy expanded 7.6 % , its fastest pace since 1995 , as exports rebounded from their depressed 2009 level .
Antigovernment protests during March-May and the country 's polarized political situation had - at most - a temporary impact on business and consumer confidence .
Although tourism was hit hard during the protests , its quick recovery helped boost consumer confidence to new highs .
Moreover , business and investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand 's stock market grew almost 5 % during the three-month period .
The economy probably will continue to experience high grow well into 2011 .

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which includes the world 's 30 richest nations , says its member economies will grow 2.7 percent this year , which is eight-tenths of a percentage point faster than earlier predictions .
The OECD says the nations that use the euro will expand more slowly ( 1.2 percent ) .
The report 's authors call on European nations to take " bolder " measures to cope with debt and other issues .
The report also says trade flows are rising again and strong growth in China and other emerging nations is helping to pull other countries out of recession .
But the OECD cautions that emerging economies should be careful to avoid the threat of inflation .
The United Nations says it will stop distributing food to Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip on Monday , because its vehicles have run out of fuel .
Gaza has been suffering fuel shortages because of Israeli cutbacks in fuel supplies to the territory and a strike by Palestinian fuel distributors .

The hostages include two employees of the French nuclear energy firm Areva and five with a subsidiary of the French construction company Vinci .
The group has warned the French government against doing what it described as anything " stupid . "
The al-Qaida group has carried out previous kidnappings in the region , including that of a 78-year-old Frenchman who was abducted in Niger in April and later killed .
The U.S. state of Connecticut began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples Wednesday , making it the second state in the nation to permit gay marriage .
Superior Court judge Jonathan Silbert cleared the way for same-sex unions earlier today , just over a week after Californian voters banned gay marriage in their state .

Turkey 's parliament on Tuesday extended the mandate that allows the military to strike at Kurdish separatist rebels based in neighboring northern Iraq .
The move to extend the mandate by one year coincides with Turkish government efforts to garner support for reforms to boost the rights of Kurds and encourage the rebels to lay down their arms .
Turkish warplanes and artillery units have staged a series of attacks on rebel bases in northern Iraq during the past two years , as part of Turkey 's battle against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK .

Iran 's newly elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Aides to Iranian President-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have again rejected accusations that he was involved in the 1979 seizure of the American embassy in Tehran .
One senior campaign advisor said Saturday that photographs of a hostage-taker purported to be a young Mr. Ahmadinejad actually show someone else .
Some of the hostage-takers also have denied that he played any role in the siege .
And other aides to the president-elect have added to the denials .
The White House says it is looking into allegations linking the Iranian president-elect to the crisis that lasted 444 days .
Another accusation against Mr. Ahmadinejad has surfaced in Europe .
An Austrian political figure contends that the Iranian president-elect was involved in the 1989 slaying in Vienna of a Kurdish opposition leader .

An Afghan official says the country has made significant progress in its war on drugs .
The deputy interior minister for counternarcotics , General Mohammed Daoud , says anti-drug forces confiscated 40 tons of opium in the first five months of this year , compared to 135 tons during last full year and 10 tons in 2003 .
His comments follow U.S. criticism of the Afghan anti-opium program , and President Hamid Karzai 's recent visit to Washington , where he promised to eradicate Afghan poppy production in the next six years .
Afghanistan is the world 's largest producer of opium .
Washington is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan 's anti-drug efforts , saying the opium growing industry is now a bigger threat there than the remaining Taleban-led militants .
Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the MILOSEVIC era and maintained its own central bank , adopted the Deutchmark , then the euro - rather than the Yugoslav dinar - as official currency , collected customs tariffs , and managed its own budget .
The dissolution of the loose political union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate membership in several international financial institutions , such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development .
In January 2007 , Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF .
Montenegro is pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European Union in October 2007 .
The European Council granted candidate country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session .
Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key political and economic problems .
Montenegro has privatized its large aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its financial sector , and has begun to attract foreign direct investment in the tourism sector .
The global financial crisis has had a significant negative impact on the economy , due to the ongoing credit crunch , a decline in the real estate sector , and a fall in aluminum exports .
Afghanistan 's economy is recovering from decades of conflict .
The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance , the recovery of the agricultural sector , and service sector growth .
Despite the progress of the past few years , Afghanistan is extremely poor , landlocked , and highly dependent on foreign aid , agriculture , and trade with neighboring countries .
Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing , clean water , electricity , medical care , and jobs .
Criminality , insecurity , weak governance , and the Afghan Government 's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth .
Afghanistan 's living standards are among the lowest in the world .
While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan 's development , pledging over $ 67 billion at four donors ' conferences since 2002 , the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges , including low revenue collection , anemic job creation , high levels of corruption , weak government capacity , and poor public infrastructure .
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy .
It depends on imports of crude oil , grains , raw materials , and military equipment .
Despite limited natural resources , Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years .
Cut diamonds , high-technology equipment , and agricultural products ( fruits and vegetables ) are the leading exports .
Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits , which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans .
Roughly half of the government 's external debt is owed to the US , its major source of economic and military aid .
Israel 's GDP , after contracting slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the high-technology sector , grew about 5 % per year from 2004 - 7 .
The global financial crisis of 2008 - 9 spurred a brief recession in Israel , but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector , and the economy has shown signs of an early recovery .
Following GDP growth of 4 % in 2008 , Israel 's GDP slipped to 0.2 % in 2009 , but reached 3.4 % in 2010 , as exports rebounded .
The global economic downturn affected Israel 's economy primarily through reduced demand for Israel 's exports in the United States and EU , Israel 's top trading partners .
Exports of goods and services account for about 40 % of the country 's GDP .
The Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows , purchasing government bonds , and intervening in the foreign currency market .
The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank 's target and the economy began to show signs of recovery .
Among the 25 poorest countries in the world , Mali is a landlocked country highly dependent on gold mining and agricultural exports for revenue .
The country 's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest .
Mali remains dependent on foreign aid .
Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65 % of its land area is desert or semidesert .
About 10 % of the population is nomadic and some 80 % of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing .
Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities .
The government has continued an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow , diversify , and attract foreign investment .
Mali is developing its cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue sources because gold production has started to fall .
Mali has invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry .
Mali 's adherence to economic reform and the 50 % devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5 % average in 1996 - 2010 .
Worker remittances and external trade routes for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire .
However , Mali is building a road network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a railway line to Senegal .
In 2010 , Mali experienced a regional drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods .
The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US .
The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown .
The key tourist industry employs about 50 % of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of GDP .
Japanese tourists predominate .
Annual tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years , but financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown .
The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts , breadfruit , tomatoes , and melons .
Garment production is by far the most important industry with the employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US under duty and quota exemptions .
THE LION , the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase .
Having secured a large booty , the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty .
The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice .
The Lion , bursting out into a great rage , devoured the Ass .
Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division .
The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel .
The Lion said , " Who has taught you , my very excellent fellow , the art of division ? You are perfect to a fraction . "
He replied , " I learned it from the Ass , by witnessing his fate . "
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others .
A JUDGE was awakened by the noise of a lawyer prosecuting a Thief .
Rising in wrath he was about to sentence the Thief to life imprisonment when the latter said :
" I beg that you will set me free , and I will some day requite your kindness . "
Pleased and flattered to be bribed , although by nothing but an empty promise , the Judge let him go.
Soon afterward he found that it was more than an empty promise , for , having become a Thief , he was himself set free by the other , who had become a Judge .
If you love something , set it free .
If it comes back , it was and always will be yours .
If it never returns , it was never yours to begin with .
If it just sits in your living room and messes up your stuff , eats your food , uses your telephone , takes your money and never behaves as if you actually set it free in the first place -- you either married it or gave birth to it !
Canadian officials say Japan is banning all poultry exports from Canada after bird flu was found in a duck in the western province of British Columbia .
Officials also say Hong Kong , Taiwan , and the United States are imposing temporary bans on poultry from British Columbia .
The sick duck came from a commercial farm near Vancouver .
Canadian authorities said Monday the duck did not have the same bird flu strain that has killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003 .
But they are killing almost 60-thousand ducks on the farm as a precaution .
Also Monday , Romanian officials said British lab tests confirmed four dead chickens in a remote Danube River village had bird flu .
China 's agriculture ministry also said Monday that bird flu has been found in chickens , ducks , and geese last week in Inner Mongolia and Hubei province .
Venezuela 's state-owned oil company says it is beginning to explore for oil in Cuban waters as part of a joint venture with the island 's state-owned Cubapetroleo .
Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) said in a statement that the project would cover a 10,000-square-kilometer area and begin Wednesday .
The Venezuelan company says it expects to confirm the presence of light crude oil after conducting a seismic study .
Earlier this year , Venezuela offered discounted oil to Cuba , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Haiti in exchange for becoming the sole provider to those countries .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his country 's oil will help with both economic and social development in the area .
The proposal called for Venezuela to offer oil at a 50 percent discount .
Venezuela sells about 98,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Cuba .
In return , Cuba provides Venezuela with medical personnel .
Authorities in Niger have detained a local journalist they say is linked to Tuareg rebels in the northern part of the country .
Moussa Kaka , a reporter for Radio France International , has been held since Thursday .
He is accused of what authorities call " conniving " with the rebel Niger Movement for Justice .
The rebel group has captured about 40 soldiers during raids in northern Niger this year .
Another 40 government troops have been killed in rebel attacks .
Tuareg rebels have been demanding a larger share of royalties from uranium mining in the northeast .
The government dismisses the rebels as bandits and drug traffickers .
Niger temporarily suspended local Radio France FM broadcasts in July , claiming their reports were biased toward the rebels .
Radio France confirmed Kaka 's detention on its Web site .
It did not comment on the charges against him .
The U.S. Senate has confirmed the nomination of federal Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court .
The final vote was 58-to-42 , largely along party lines .
Tuesday 's vote came after the Republican-controlled Senate on Monday stopped an effort by opposition Democrats to extend the debate over Alito 's nomination .
Judge Alito is expected to be sworn in today and to attend the president 's State of the Union address with the other Supreme Court justices .
He replaces Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , who is retiring .
She was known as a " swing voter " on the Court , meaning she sometimes sided with the more conservative justices and sometimes with the more liberal ones .
Alito 's critics say he will move the Supreme Court in a more conservative direction , especially on issues like abortion and civil rights .
Delegates to a U.N. conference on global warming are working hard in the meeting 's final hours to reach a deal on long-term efforts to cut carbon emissions .
The biggest stumbling block is the United States , which rejects the Kyoto Protocol on cutting " greenhouse , " or heat-trapping , emissions .
Delegates want to extend talks on the accord , which is set to expire in 2012 .
The Bush administration says the protocol would hurt the U.S. economy , and says it unfairly exempts developing nations such as China and India .
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton rejected that charge in a surprise talk at the Montreal , Canada , summit Friday .
Mr. Clinton , who endorsed the Kyoto protocols while president , told delegates the accord would not hurt developed nations .
He added it was time to stop doubting the effect of these gases , saying " climate change is real . "
Britain has announced plans for a database of extremists who would face automatic questioning and could be barred from entering the country .

He told parliament the database will list people known for unacceptable behavior such as preaching radical ideas , running extremist websites or writing articles that could foment terrorism .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Tony Blair told lawmakers he is considering calling an international conference on ways to root out Islamic extremism .
He said it would address such issues as ways of dealing with Islamic schools that teach extremism .

Attorney Abdul Rahman Barman says Giddens , who converted to Islam , moved to Yemen in 2006 .
He says Yemeni authorities have not provided any specific reason for her arrest .
The French News Agency quotes Barman as saying people get arrested in Yemen based on " wrong U.S. intelligence information . "
He says many are accused of having links to al-Qaida .
Germany 's constitutional court has rejected a request by two lawmakers to prevent the deployment of German fighter jets in Afghanistan to support NATO forces there .
The lawmakers argued that sending the aircraft would entangle Germany in what the plaintiffs called " illegal operations " of the U.S. military .
The two are from German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's governing Christian Democratic party and its allied party , the Christian Social Union .
The two lawmakers went to court after Germany 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly Friday ( 405 - 157 ) to send the Tornado aircraft .
The planes are to provide NATO forces with aerial images of the positions of Taleban fighters .
Opponents say the mission amounts to a combat role for the German planes .

Italy has a diversified industrial economy , which is divided into a developed industrial north , dominated by private companies , and a less-developed , welfare-dependent , agricultural south , with high unemployment .
The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises , many of them family owned .
Italy also has a sizable underground economy , which by some estimates accounts for as much as 15 % of GDP .
These activities are most common within the agriculture , construction , and service sectors .
Italy has moved slowly on implementing needed structural reforms , such as reducing graft , overhauling costly entitlement programs , and increasing employment opportunities for young workers , particularly women .
The international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy 's labor market , with unemployment rising from 6.2 % in 2007 to 8.4 % in 2010 , but in the longer-term Italy 's low fertility rate and quota-driven immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy .
A rise in exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1 % in 2010 following a 5 % contraction in 2009 .
The Italian government has struggled to limit government spending , but Italy 's exceedingly high public debt remains above 115 % of GDP , and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5 % of GDP in 2007 - exceeded 5 % in 2009 and 4 % in 2010 , as the costs of servicing the country 's debt rose .

French Togoland became Togo in 1960 .
Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA , installed as military ruler in 1967 , ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades .
Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in the early 1990s , the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA , whose Rally of the Togolese People ( RPT ) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a majority of seats in today 's legislature .
Upon EYADEMA 's death in February 2005 , the military installed the president 's son , Faure GNASSINGBE , and then engineered his formal election two months later .
Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007 .
After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses , Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community .
The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of welfare capitalism , featuring a combination of free market activity and government intervention .
The government controls key areas , such as the vital petroleum sector , through large-scale state-majority-owned enterprises .
The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum , hydropower , fish , forests , and minerals - and is highly dependent on the petroleum sector , which accounts for nearly half of exports and over 30 % of state revenue .
Norway is the world 's second-largest gas exporter ; its position as an oil exporter has slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline .
Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994 ; nonetheless , as a member of the European Economic Area , it contributes sizably to the EU budget .
In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production , Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world 's second largest sovereign wealth fund , valued at over $ 500 billion in 2010 .
After solid GDP growth in 2004 - 7 , the economy slowed in 2008 , and contracted in 2009 , before returning to positive growth in 2010 .

A noted biologist , who had been studying little green frogs in a swamp , was stumped .
The frog population , despite efforts at predator control , was declining at an alarming rate .
A chemist at a nearby college came up with a solution :
The frogs , due to a chemical change in the swamp water , simply could n't stay coupled long enough to reproduce successfully .
The chemist then brewed up a new adhesive to assist the frogs ' togetherness , which included one part sodium .
It seems the little green frogs needed some monosodium glue to mate .

Russia 's embattled oil giant Yukos says a Moscow court has frozen the company 's stake in the Sibneft oil firm .
The business daily Vedomosti says the action could pave the way for the 34.5 percent stake to be seized if authorities prove it was acquired with illegal funds .

Hurricane Paula has strengthened as it threatens the Gulf Coast of Mexico and parts of Central America , forcing officials to call for the evacuation of many coastal areas .
At last report ( 1745 UTC ) , forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Paula 's maximum sustained winds had increased from 120 kilometers to 160 kilometers an hour .
Further strengthening is expected .
The storm is about 220 kilometers southeast of the Mexican resort island of Cozumel , where hurricane warnings are in effect .
It is expected to approach the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula late Tuesday and Wednesday .
Hurricane Paula could dump eight to 15 centimeters of rain over western and central Cuba , the Yucatan Peninsula and northern Belize , with some isolated areas receiving more than 25 centimeters .
Forecasters say the heavy rains could trigger flash flooding and mudslides in the region , especially in mountainous parts of Nicaragua and Honduras .
China has raised its estimate for economic growth in 2005 to 9.8 percent .
That is an increase of 0.4 percent from the government 's previous figure .
The new number was released Sunday by Ou Xinqian , vice minister of China 's National Development and Reform Commission .
The official Xinhua News Agency says the Commission adjusted its growth estimate because recent data shows China 's economy in 2004 was much bigger than previously thought .
Last month , the government raised its national output figure for 2004 by 16.8 percent over the original estimate .
Officials said service industries accounted for most of the revision .
The new growth estimate from Mr. Ou is the latest in a series of economic data released by Chinese officials .
China 's National Bureau of Statistics is expected to announce the final figures for 2005 in the coming weeks .

Local officials say initial investigation showed that the militants were brought from neighboring Afghanistan to the hospital in the provincial capital , Quetta .
They say several Taleban were being treated for wounds sustained in fighting in southern Afghanistan .
Last month , authorities in the restive Pakistani province arrested more than 200 Afghan nationals suspected of having links with Taleban militants .
Among those caught was a former commander of Taleban forces in southern Afghanistan .
The raids follow months of pressure from the Afghan government , the U.S.-led coalition and NATO forces in neighboring Afghanistan , who want Islamabad to act more forcefully against the Taleban remnants hiding in Pakistan .

The United States says it suspects Iran is trying to develop such weaponry , despite Tehran 's assertions its nuclear intentions are peaceful .
A Chilean appeals court has ruled former dictator Augusto Pinochet can not avoid prosecution for alleged human rights violations on health grounds .
In a unanimous ruling , the judges concluded that recent medical exams do not disqualify Pinochet , who is 90 years old , from standing trial .
The ruling clears the way for Pinochet to be brought to trial in connection with the murder of leftwing dissidents during his 17-year military rule from 1973 to 1990 .
The specific case relates to a campaign , known as " Operation Colombo , " in which 119 dissidents disappeared in 1975 and were believed killed .

A Tata spokesman would not comment Wednesday , but there are reports that the equipment is being moved from the Singur plant in West Bengal state to Tata 's existing facility in the northern state of Uttarakhand .
The Tata plant was set to manufacture what is being called the world 's cheapest car - the " Nano . "

Efforts to resolve the standoff have failed , with protesters recently rejecting a government offer to return 30 hectares of land .
Tata officials have said they are considering moving the plant out of West Bengal .
Zimbabwe has condemned opposition activists for stamping protest messages on the country 's bank notes .
Deputy Finance Minister David Chapfika warned Wednesday the government would punish those behind the vandalism .
No group has claimed responsibility for printing the words " enough " and " get up , stand up " on some bank notes found in circulation in Zimbabwe .
Last year , officials blamed an underground rights group known as " Enough " ( Zvakwana ) for a similar campaign in which messages were printed on condom packages .

Tuvalu consists of a densely populated , scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil .
The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel .
Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities .
Fewer than 1,000 tourists , on average , visit Tuvalu annually .
Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed .
About 15 % of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad , and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $ 2 million in 2007 .
Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund ( TTF ) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia , NZ , and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea .
Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals , this fund grew from an initial $ 17 million to an estimated value of $ 77 million in 2006 .
The TTF contributed nearly $ 9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government 's budget .
The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries .
In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability , the government is pursuing public sector reforms , including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts .
Tuvalu also derives royalties from the lease of its " .tv " Internet domain name with revenue of more than $ 2 million in 2006 .
A minor source of government revenue comes from the sale of stamps and coins .
With merchandise exports only a fraction of merchandise imports , continued reliance must be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees , remittances from overseas workers , official transfers , and income from overseas investments .
Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation .
Niue 's remoteness , as well as cultural and linguistic differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest of the Cook Islands , have caused it to be separately administered .
The population of the island continues to drop ( from a peak of 5,200 in 1966 to an estimated 1,311 in 2011 ) with substantial emigration to New Zealand 2,400 km to the southwest .
Anguilla has few natural resources , and the economy depends heavily on luxury tourism , offshore banking , lobster fishing , and remittances from emigrants .
Increased activity in the tourism industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector contributing to economic growth .
Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector , which is small but growing .
In the medium term , prospects for the economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and , therefore , on revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on favorable weather conditions .
A former British colony , Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule .
Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963 , when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia .
Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964 , sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island .
In 1974 , a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey , which soon controlled more than a third of the island .
In 1983 , the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " ( " TRNC " ) , but it is recognized only by Turkey .
The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reopen unification negotiations .
In September 2008 , the leaders of the two communities began negotiations under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island ; the talks remain ongoing .
The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004 , although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government , and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots .
However , individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states .
Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire , Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I .
Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945 , Austria 's status remained unclear for a decade .
A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation , recognized Austria 's independence , and forbade unification with Germany .
A constitutional law that same year declared the country 's " perpetual neutrality " as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal .
The Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 and Austria 's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality .
A prosperous , democratic country , Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 .
A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore .
Standing on a projecting rock , he played several tunes in the hope that the fish , attracted by his melody , would of their own accord dance into his net , which he had placed below .
At last , having long waited in vain , he laid aside his flute , and casting his net into the sea , made an excellent haul of fish .
When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said : " O you most perverse creatures , when I piped you would not dance , but now that I have ceased you do so merrily . "

Christmas was over .
Santa and his reindeer finally had a chance to rest .
And they deserved it .
They had done a good job .
Rudolph had a chance to do something he had wanted to do for a long time .
He made an appointment with a plastic surgeon because he was so sensitive about his looks .
However it was n't his glowing proboscis that he wanted changed .

The figures released by the General Administration of Customs Wednesday show exports totaled over $ 109 billion .
January 's increase follows on the heels of a 17.7 percent increase in December .

A funny old lion , who had the misfortune to lose his mane , was wearing a wig as he was taking a stroll on a very windy day .
Looking up , he spied one of the charming Tiger sisters across the street , and , wishing to make an impression , smiled blandly and made a beautiful low bow .
At that moment a very smart gust of wind came up , and the consequence was that his wig flew off and left him there , feeling foolish and looking worse , with his bald head glistening like a billiard ball .
Though somewhat embarrassed at first , he smiled at the Lady and said : " Is it a wonder that another fellow 's hair should n't keep on my head , when my own would n't stay there ? "
" Wit always has an answer ready . "

When they were about to devour him , one of them said :
" This is the man who removed the thorn from my foot . "

Israel 's interim prime minister , Ehud Olmert , says he hopes to resume peace talks after both the Israeli and the Palestinian parliamentary elections .
Palestinians are to hold their legislative vote on January 25 , and Israeli elections are set for March 28 .
Mr. Olmert said resuming peace talks will depend on Israel 's long-standing demand that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas disarm militant groups .
He said the basis for the talks would be the U.S.-backed " road map " peace plan , which calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state .
Also Tuesday , Israeli police began forcibly removing right-wing settlers from the West Bank city of Hebron .
The settlers have been protesting a court order evicting Jewish squatters from an abandoned Palestinian market in the city .
Elsewhere in the West Bank , Israeli troops shot and killed a wanted Palestinian militant in Tulkarem .

A poll published by the Ha'aretz daily newspaper had similar results .
The opinion polls are the first to test the future for Mr. Sharon 's new party since the prime minister suffered a massive stroke on Wednesday and was said by doctors to be unlikely to return to his post .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says some of Russia 's efforts at democratic reform are " going in the wrong direction . "
Rice told CBS television Sunday that the way Russia used energy against Ukraine and a new law regulating non-governmental organizations are problems .
Russia cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine during a price dispute last month , causing gas shortages in Europe .

The head of the U.S. central bank says a variety of factors , from a weaker dollar to tougher budget discipline in Congress , may help restrain the rapid growth in the nation 's trade deficit .
In remarks prepared for a speech in London , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cautioned that the unprecedented level of economic interaction between countries makes it difficult to predict what will happen to the U.S. trade deficit .
Economists say that to finance the trade gap , the United States depends on the willingness of foreigners to lend money to the country through investments like stocks and bonds .
Analysts worry that the declining dollar might prompt investors to abruptly sell their stocks , which could push the dollar down further and force interest rates up .
That could slow the U.S. economy and hurt nations that export to the huge U.S. market .
A federal judge in the U.S. state of Iowa has awarded a small Internet service provider more than one billion dollars in a lawsuit aimed against unsolicited commercial e-mails , known as spam .
The ruling Friday is believed to be the largest judgment ever against people or companies who send spam .
Robert Kramer , whose company provides e-mail service for about 5,000 users in Iowa , had filed a lawsuit against some 300 spammers in 2003 .
Mr. Kramer 's lawyer says the entire judgment will probably never be collected , but he hopes to recover costs caused by the spammers .

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce , U.S. exports in the second quarter of 2008 expanded at an annualized rate of nine-point-two percent , thanks in large part to a decline in the value of the dollar against other currencies Many U.S. exporters are benefiting from the weak dollar , which makes American goods cheaper abroad , and boosts U.S. firms ' profits when they convert overseas earnings back into dollars .

The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I .
In 1918 , the Croats , Serbs , and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia .
Following World War II , Yugoslavia became a federal independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO .
Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 , it took four years of sporadic , but often bitter , fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands .
Under UN supervision , the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998 .
In April 2009 , Croatia joined NATO ; it is a candidate for eventual EU accession .
A military power during the 17th century , Sweden has not participated in any war for almost two centuries .
An armed neutrality was preserved in both world wars .
Sweden 's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000 - 2 and 2009 by the global economic downturns , but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries .
Sweden joined the EU in 1995 , but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum .
The economy , one of the most stable and prosperous in the Caribbean , is highly dependent on tourism generating an estimated 45 % of the national income .
More than 9,34,000 tourists , mainly from the US , visited the islands in 2008 .
In the mid-1980s , the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands , and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues .
Roughly 4,00,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000 .
The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994 , which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses , made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business .
Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity ; poor soils limit the islands ' ability to meet domestic food requirements .
Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands , the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959 .
Sri Lanka is engaging in large-scale reconstruction and development projects following the end of the 26-year conflict with the LTTE , including increasing electricity access and rebuilding its road and rail network .
Additionally , Sri Lanka seeks to reduce poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas , develop small and medium enterprises , and promote increased agriculture .
High levels of government funding may be difficult , as the government already is faced with high debt interest payments , a bloated civil service , and historically high budget deficits .
The 2008 - 9 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka 's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis , which was alleviated by a $ 2.6 billion IMF standby agreement in July 2009 .
The end of the civil war and the IMF loan , however , have largely restored investors ' confidence , reflected in part by the Sri Lankan stock market 's recognition as one of the best performing markets in the world .
Sri Lankan growth rates averaged nearly 5 % in during the war , but increased government spending on development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP growth to around 06-Jul % per year in 2006 - 8 .
After experiencing 3.5 % growth in 2009 , Sri Lanka 's economy is poised to achieve high growth rates in the postwar period .
A MAN wished to purchase an Ass , and agreed with its owner that he should try out the animal before he bought him .
He took the Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses , upon which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all .
Seeing this , the man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner .
On being asked how , in so short a time , he could have made a trial of him , he answered , " I do not need a trial ; I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his companion . "
A man is known by the company he keeps .
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN , whose hair had begun to turn gray , courted two women at the same time .
One of them was young , and the other well advanced in years .
The elder woman , ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself , made a point , whenever her admirer visited her , to pull out some portion of his black hairs .
The younger , on the contrary , not wishing to become the wife of an old man , was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find .
Thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head .
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody .
Lena once had two chickens .
One of them got terribly sick .
So she killed the other one to make soup to get the first one well again .
John Garang
The Sudan People 's Liberation Movement says funeral services for its late political leader , Sudanese Vice President John Garang , will be held in Juba , the planned capital of an autonomous southern Sudan .
It is unclear when the funeral will be held .
Mr. Garang 's political party says the body of the former rebel leader , who died Saturday evening in a helicopter crash , is lying at New Site in Southern Sudan .
Sudan 's government on Monday declared a night curfew in the capital , Khartoum , to prevent riots that erupted following news of his death .
At least 36 people were killed in the violence .
Mr. Garang was a key figure in the peace accord reached this year between the Sudanese government and southern rebels to end a 21-year civil war .
Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir and General Salva Kiir Mayardit , who was named by the SPLM to succeed Mr. Garang , have stressed that his death will not stop the peace movement .

A separatist group fighting Indonesian troops in Aceh has rejected the government 's offer to let rebel leaders run for political office , but only as part of existing political parties .
A Free Aceh Movement spokesman said Friday at peace talks in Helsinki , Finland that if the rebel group agreed to the offer , it would mean the organization was given privileges not available to others in Aceh .
The spokesman says that is not acceptable .
On Thursday , Indonesia 's government proposed that Aceh rebels be allowed to field candidates in existing political parties , but not as a new party .
The proposal would require a change in Indonesian law , which says parties must have representation in at least half of the country 's 32 provinces .

The price of crude oil for future delivery reached $ 66.15 a barrel in New York trading .
Prices are up six percent this week and have more than doubled since the end of 2003 .
Analysts blame the latest increases on strong demand for oil , a spate of refinery problems , and worries that Middle East tensions could crimp crude oil supplies .

Western Sahara has a small market-based economy whose main industries are fishing , phosphate mining , and pastoral nomadism .
The territory 's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture difficult , and Western Sahara imports much of its food .
The Moroccan Government administers Western Sahara 's economy and is a source of employment , infrastructure development , and social spending in the territory .
Western Sahara 's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between Morocco and the Polisario .
Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast of Morocco , including the disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara .
Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially significant quantities , but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory .
Western Sahara 's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory .
Since 1962 , when France stationed military personnel in the region , French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence agricultural economy to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed by the military or supports the tourist industry .
With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996 , the military contribution to the economy fell sharply .
Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings .
Other sources of income are pearl farming and deep-sea commercial fishing .
The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural products .
The territory benefits substantially from development agreements with France aimed principally at creating new businesses and strengthening social services .
