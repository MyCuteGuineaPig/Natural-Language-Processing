Argentina benefits from rich natural resources , a highly literate population , an export-oriented agricultural sector , and a diversified industrial base .
Although one of the world 's wealthiest countries 100 years ago , Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises , persistent fiscal and current account deficits , high inflation , mounting external debt , and capital flight .
A severe depression , growing public and external indebtedness , and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic , social , and political crisis in the country 's turbulent history .
Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government 's foreign debt in December of that year , and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office .
His successor , Eduardo DUHALDE , announced an end to the peso 's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002 .
The economy bottomed out that year , with real GDP 18 % smaller than in 1998 and almost 60 % of Argentines under the poverty line .
Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5 % annually over the subsequent six years , taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor , an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden , excellent international financial conditions , and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies .
Inflation also increased , however , during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER , which responded with price restraints on businesses , as well as export taxes and restraints , and beginning in early 2007 , with understating inflation data .
Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007 , and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession .
The economy has rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession , but the government 's continued reliance on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already high inflation .
The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture - primarily bananas - in years past , but increasingly has been driven by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an " ecotourism " destination .
In order to diversify the island 's production base , the government also is attempting to develop an offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to develop geothermal energy resources .
In 2003 , the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination of price controls , privatization of the state banana company , and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF requirements .
This restructuring paved the way for an economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and helped to reduce the debt burden , which remains at about 85 % of GDP .
Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages equivalent to 20 % of GDP .
In 2009 , growth slowed as a result of the global recession ; it picked up only slightly in 2010 .
Burundi is a landlocked , resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector .
The economy is predominantly agricultural which accounts for just over 30 % of GDP and employs more than 90 % of the population .
Burundi 's primary exports are coffee and tea , which account for 90 % of foreign exchange earnings , though exports are a relatively small share of GDP .
Burundi 's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices .
The Tutsi minority , 14 % of the population , dominates the coffee trade .
An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 2,00,000 deaths , forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania , and displaced 1,40,000 others internally .
Only one in two children go to school , and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV / AIDS .
Food , medicine , and electricity remain in short supply .
Less than 2 % of the population has electricity in its homes .
Burundi 's GDP grew around 4 % annually in 2006 - 10 .
Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased , but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate , poor education rates , a weak legal system , a poor transportation network , overburdened utilities , and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms .
The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation .
Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors ; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government 's revenues and its ability to pay salaries .
Burundi joined the East African Community , which should boost Burundi 's regional trade ties , and received $ 700 million in debt relief in 2009 .
Government corruption is also hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules .
A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place .
The day being intensely hot , and the sun shining in its strength , the Traveler stopped to rest , and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the Ass .
As this afforded only protection for one , and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it , a violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the right to the Shadow .
The owner maintained that he had let the Ass only , and not his Shadow .
The Traveler asserted that he had , with the hire of the Ass , hired his Shadow also .
The quarrel proceeded from words to blows , and while the men fought , the Ass galloped off .
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance .
A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him , causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help .
When the Flea a second time hopped upon his foot , he groaned and said , " O Hercules ! if you will not help me against a Flea , how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists ? '
In the old days , when men were allowed to have many wives , a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young ; each loved him very much , and desired to see him like herself .
Now the Man 's hair was turning grey , which the young Wife did not like , as it made him look too old for her husband .
So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones .
But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure , for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother .
So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could .
The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald .
Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield .
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is optimistic a deal with Iran on its controversial nuclear program can be reached .
During a visit to Hungary Tuesday , Mr. Putin said it is quite possible to reach agreement on Moscow 's proposal to enrich uranium on Russian soil for Iran 's nuclear energy needs .
Iran has said it agrees in principle to the deal .
But it is unclear if it would also agree to stop domestic uranium enrichment - a demand of Russia and the West .
A Japanese official Tuesday quoted Iran 's visiting Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as saying that the Russian plan would be a bridge between Iran 's right to peaceful nuclear energy and global trust in Tehran .
The United States and European Union say Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons - a charge it denies .
An international media group says it is disturbed by the recent arrests of two television broadcasters by Afghan authorities .
Reporters Without Borders says Fahim Kohdamani of Emroz TV and Ajmal Alamzai of Ariana TV were arrested on Monday for airing programs deemed anti-Islamic and for speaking with Taliban representatives .
It says Kohdamani was arrested for broadcasting music and hosting an entertainment program .
In a statement Tuesday , the group says his arrest appeared to be linked to a letter of complaint sent to President Hamid Karzai by Muslim clerics .
Alamzai , the host of Ariana TV 's program " Didadgah , " was detained for speaking with a Taliban member during a program that discussed U.S. efforts to reach out to moderate Islamic insurgents .
The statement says he was released late Monday evening .
North Korea says it will not dismantle its nuclear program before any new talks aimed at eliminating its access to nuclear weapons .
The commentary in the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper also says Pyongyang has neither opposed nor shunned the six-party talks on its nuclear ambitions .
The newspaper comments come amid renewed speculation that a new round of negotiations could begin within the next few weeks .
Three rounds of talks have been held in Beijing , but a fourth session scheduled for June , 2004 failed to take place because North Korea boycotted the process over what it called a hostile U.S. attitude .
But earlier this month , North Korean leader Kim Jong-il said the talks could resume as early as July .
Authorities in Haiti say gunmen shot and killed two police officers and a civilian Monday in an apparent ambush in Port-au-Prince .

The United Nations mission and Haitian police have struggled to restore order to Haiti for more than a year , after an armed uprising ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
A U.S. Congressional investigation into Hurricane Katrina blames failures at all levels of government for the suffering and loss of life that resulted from last August 's storm .
U.S. news organizations have published parts of a draft of the final document that is to be presented Wenesday to Congress .
The report says the federal government 's response to Katrina was marked by ineffectiveness and organizational paralysis .
It also faulted local and state officials in Louisiana for delaying mandatory evacuations .
The report notes that problems first noted after the September 11 terrorist attacks - such as the inability of first responders to communicate with each - were again problems during the Katrina response .
Democrats , who wanted an independent probe , boycotted the investigation carried out by Republican members of the House of Representatives .
Egypt says it will not ratify a key treaty banning nuclear tests unless Israel first signs a separate agreement calling for a halt to the spread of atomic bombs .
In Cairo Friday , Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit linked Egyptian ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to Israeli acceptance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty , or NPT .
Mr. Gheit said the refusal of Israel to sign the non-proliferation accord is a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East .
All Middle Eastern countries except Israel have signed the NPT , which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons .
Israel and Egypt have both signed the other treaty banning nuclear tests , but neither nation has ratified it .
Israel has not officially stated that it has nuclear weapons , but it is widely believed to have about 200 nuclear warheads .
Security in Nepal 's capital remained tight Sunday , as police searched an area south of Kathmandu for rebels who launched a deadly pre-dawn attack on government troops .
The military says 17 rebels and at least six security personnel were killed in the fighting , which came as opponents of King Gyanendra 's direct rule continued to defy a government crackdown .
Elsewhere , authorities say suspected rebels shot dead a candidate for local office in the southern town of Janakpur .
The victim was identified as the local leader of a party that supports King Gyanendra .
Authorities say at least 30 protesters were arrested in the capital Sunday .
However , the royal government released former Prime Minister Gijira Prasad Koirala and several other leaders placed under house arrest last week .
Nepal 's main political parties vowed to continue the protests and called for a nationwide strike on Thursday .
The U.S. banking industry lost more than $ 26 billion in the last three months of 2008 , the first quarterly loss in 18 years .
The number of banks that regulators classify as " troubled " rose nearly 50 percent during the same quarter .
Banks lost money as the recession made it harder for borrowers to repay loans .
Banks were also hurt by losses on their investments in stocks and other areas .
The U.S. government 's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says the number of banks that actually fail is growing , with 25 going under last year .
Although the weak economy has resulted in increased losses for banks , the American Bankers Association said Thursday 97 percent of all the country 's banks are still rated " well capitalized " - meaning they have a significant financial buffer against losses .
There are more than 8,000 banks in the United States insured by the FDIC .
The Afghan government has welcomed the extradition of 14 Taleban insurgents from Pakistan to Kabul , but also urged its neighbor to hunt down more suspected militants hiding in Pakistan .
A government spokesman says such moves will strengthen relations between the two countries and will open a new era of cooperation in the war against terrorism .
Among those extradited were purported Taleban spokesmen Latif Hakimi and Mohammad Yasir .
Afghan state television showed Afghan soldiers leading the 14 men , all blindfolded , off a military plane late Wednesday .
Afghan officials say they will be put on trial for their role in violence against government targets , as well as Afghan and coalition forces .
Meanwhile , a bomb attached to a bicycle blew up Thursday , in the southern city of Kandahar , killing a policeman and wounding two civilians .
Lebanese officials say rescuers have recovered two bodies from the waters off Lebanon 's northern coast where a cargo ship carrying 83 crew members and livestock sank late Thursday .
The officials say Lebanese navy boats and United Nations vessels participating in the rescue mission also pulled at least 25 people from the rough Mediterranean waters .
Local authorities say the Panamanian-flagged vessel , carrying livestock from Uruguay to the Syrian port of Tartous , capsized some 17 kilometers off the Lebanese port of Tripoli in a heavy rainstorm .
They say the crew sent a distress call but the vessel sank before the rescue ships could reach the area .
Thursday 's accident came less than a week after a Togolese-flagged cargo ship with 12 crew on board sank off the Lebanese coast .
Six crew members were rescued but the rest remain missing .

About one thousand U.S. troops launched the offensive near the Syrian border , in the latest attempt to drive insurgents from the area .
Residents said the operation appeared to be widening Sunday to several nearby towns .
Meanwhile , U.S. officials said they had no reason to believe an alleged statement from al Qaida in Iraq claiming to have kidnapped two Marines involved in the military offensive .
In a statement , U.S. officials said they were conducting checks to verify that all Marines were accounted for .

Al-Qaida has claimed responsibility for the July 7 London subway and bus bombings that killed 52 people .
The Arabic language television network al-Jazeera Thursday broadcast what it said is a videotape of one of the bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan , made just before the attack .
On the video , he blames the bombings on British support for the war in Iraq and what he calls atrocities against Muslims .
British officials say four suicide bombers were killed in the July 7 attacks .
An attempted bombing two weeks later failed .
It is still not clear if there is a direct tie between the two attacks .
The videotape also included comments from al-Qaida 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahiri .
He warned that British Prime Minster Tony Blair 's policies would bring more destruction to the British people .
The British Foreign Office said it will not comment on any aspects of the tape .

Former Haitian president Rene Preval has been declared the winner of the Caribbean nation 's presidential election .
Haiti 's Provisional Electoral Council said Thursday , Mr. Preval received 51 percent of the votes cast last week .
His total was raised after a last minute decision to discount 85,000 blank ballots .
Haitian Prime Minister Gerard Latortue told the Associated Press the government acknowledged the final decision of the electoral council and saluted Mr. Preval 's election .
The announcement follows five days of protests by Preval supporters who alleged massive voter fraud .
Mr. Preval urged his supporters to demonstrate peacefully .
Haitian officials stopped the vote count Wednesday after thousands of ballots were found burning in a trash heap outside the capital , Port-au-Prince .
Nepal 's government says it will push ahead with planned parliamentary elections even if Maoist rebels do not come the negotiating table by January 13 .
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba told journalists in Kathmandu Thursday it is their last chance to present their demands for ending their decades-long violent campaign .
He said he is determined to set the process for holding parliamentary elections in motion with or without the rebels ' participation .
There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas , who have demanded United Nations or an international human rights group mediate the talks with Kathmandu .
Violence has surged since peace talks failed last year after the Maoists demanded election of a special assembly to decide the future of the monarchy .

Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko says the United States understands the problems Ukraine faces in its democratic development , and its need for energy security .
Tymoshenko met in Washington Thursday with Vice President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley .
The former Ukrainian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Friday .
After her meetings Thursday , Tymoshenko said Ukraine faces a real threat of losing its political sovereignty , independence and integration with the European community for the first time in 15 years .
Ukraine is struggling with a political stalemate between supporters of West-leaning reformer President Viktor Yushchenko , and those of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych , who wants stronger ties with Russia .
President Yushchenko and Tymoshenko were once allies , but their relationship deteriorated because of bitter political infighting a year after the 2004 Orange Revolution that swept Mr. Yushchenko to power .
Pakistan says it would welcome India 's participation in a proposed gas pipeline with Iran worth $ 4 billion dollars , but says that the project will go ahead even if New Delhi does not join it .
Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri made the comment after Tuesday 's meeting with his Iranian counterpart , Kamal Kharrazi , in Islamabad .
Iran proposed the pipeline in 1996 .
But New Delhi 's response has been lukewarm given its troubled relations with Islamabad and concerns about the safety of the pipeline carrying its energy supplies through Pakistani territory .
Mr. Kharrazi 's visit came as India and Pakistan concluded another round of slow-moving peace talks .
The Iranian foreign minister met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf late Monday .
Before leaving Pakistan , Mr. Kharrazi held talks with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz .
President Bush says federal officials have " deep concern " about Tropical Storm Rita causing more flooding in New Orleans .
In remarks at the White House Monday , Mr. Bush said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fears that heavy rain could cause the city 's recently-repaired levees to break again .
Much of New Orleans sits below sea level , and the levees ' failure during Hurricane Katrina put 80 percent of the city underwater .
Weather forecasters say Tropical Storm Rita could become a hurricane and move into the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans later this week .
The president said New Orleans officials must be " realistic " about bringing people back to the city before it is safe .
Iran says the only solution to its nuclear dispute with the West is negotiations , and not referral of its atomic energy program to the U.N. Security Council .
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi made that assertion Sunday at his weekly news conference in Tehran .
Asefi cautioned the West against acting in haste against Iran , saying a referral to the Security Council would solve nothing .
The Iranian spokesman 's comments came as representatives of Britain , Germany , France , the United States and the European Union prepared for a meeting Monday in London to discuss whether to refer Iran to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions .
The Europeans say the impasse should be resolved through diplomacy , but Washington says a military option should be retained as a last resort .

Jordanian King Abdullah has vowed to track down and bring to justice the militants who helped plan the suicide bombings on three hotels .
Government officials said most of the dead are Jordanians , but at least 12 foreigners have been identified , including two Americans .
Turkish and European Union officials are meeting Monday in Ankara to discuss Turkey 's progress in making reforms ahead of EU membership talks scheduled for later this year .
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn is expected to press Turkey to sign a protocol that will amount to a de-facto recognition of Cyprus ' internationally-recognized Greek government .
Turkey must sign the protocol before formal EU membership talks can begin on October third .
Ankara previously refused to recognize the Greek government of Cyprus , which joined the EU last May .
Turkey is the only country in the world that recognizes the government of the Turkish-ruled part of Cyprus .
Mr. Rehn is also expected to push Ankara to continue with efforts to stop torture , improve freedom of expression , and increase the rights of women and the Kurdish minority .
Scientists are hailing the results of a new study that shows a drug already used to treat advanced cancer has proven extremely effective against an aggressive form of early breast cancer .
In an article published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , researchers found the drug Herceptin can prevent 50 percent of all breast tumors from recurring in patients with early stages of the disease .
The drug , which targets only diseased cells , only works for the estimated 20-percent of breast cancer cases in which tumors produce too much of a protein known as HER-2 .
Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer among women in the United States .
More than 2,00,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer , and about 40,000 women will die of the disease in the United States in 2005 .
Officials say Herceptin will be marketed internationally by the Swiss drugmaker Roche .

In the past , insurgents have attacked pilgrims during Ashura observances .
In 2004 , about 170 people were killed .
Pope Benedict XVI says science has narrowed humanity 's understanding of the origins of life and that the theory of evolution can neither be proven or dismissed .
The pope 's extended views on evolution are appearing in print for the first time as part of a newly published German book called Creation and Evolution .
He writes that evolution can never be known for sure because it is impossible to conduct controlled laboratory experiments into the theory .
But Benedict does not give a 100 percent endorsement of creationism or intelligent design , saying the debate must be philosophical and go beyond science .
Advocates of intelligent design say life on Earth is too complex to have evolved randomly and must be the product of a higher power .
A state-run Chinese newspaper reported Monday that more than 200 people are expected to go on trial this week for their involvement in sectarian riots last month in the western region of Xinjiang .
The official China Daily said the trials will take place in Urumqi , the capital of Xinjiang and the site of China 's worst ethnic violence in decades .
Nearly 200 people were killed and about 1,700 injured .
The paper said the charges include vandalizing public property , organizing crowds to cause bodily harm , robbery , murder and arson , among other crimes .
Beijing blamed the violence on outside forces stirring up separatist sentiments among the mostly Muslim Uighur minority , but Uighurs blame the police for provoking the violence .
Delegates from many of south Asian nations affected by December 's deadly tsunami are in Tokyo to study Japan 's advanced tsunami warning system .
A three-day conference sponsored by the United Nations opened Tuesday as part of an effort to establish an early tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean by mid-2006 .
The representatives from Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Thailand and other nations in the region also will visit Japanese coastal communities to see how they respond to earthquake and tsunami warnings .
Japan , which is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis , has offered to share its tsunami-warning technology to build the new Indian Ocean system .
NATO allies have raised concerns about a recent deal in Afghanistan to free five Taleban prisoners in exchange for a kidnapped Italian reporter .
U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns told reporters in Brussels Tuesday that a majority of member states oppose the exchange of hostages for terrorists .
Members Tuesday discussed adopting a common NATO policy to deal with similar hostage situations .
Early last week , the Afghan government released five Taleban militants in exchange for kidnapped journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo , who had been held for two weeks .
Britain and the United States raised objections to the deal , saying it increases the risk of similar kidnappings of NATO and Afghan troops .
Mastrogiacomo was abducted in southern Afghanistan 's Helmand province in early March .
Kidnappers beheaded his Afghan driver .
The U.S. Geological Survey says a strong earthquake has hit eastern Indonesia .
The service said Tuesday the quake had a magnitude of 6.3 and was centered in the Molucca Sea about 135 kilometers northwest of Ternate .
An Indonesian website , vivanews.com , said the quake struck at 9.08 pm local time and there appeared to be little risk of a tsunami .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
An earthquake of that magnitude can cause damage in populated areas within a radius of about 160 kilometers .
Indonesia sits on fault lines that make the region prone to earthquakes .
A tsunami triggered by a massive undersea quake in December 2004 killed nearly 2,30,000 people , half of them in Indonesia 's Aceh province .
China has imposed a massive news blackout on the deadly police suppression of a village protest in Dongzhou earlier this month .
China 's state controlled media have been nearly silent about the December 6 incident in which activists say some 20 people were shot dead by police while protesting against a local power plant .
The only official news coverage has alleged that three civilians were killed and several injured after protesters attacked police , forcing officers to respond .
The news blackout extends to the Internet , where reporters say sophisticated filtering has blocked foreign news stories and prevented search engines , such as Google , from looking for keywords associated with the shootings .
But media rights group Reporters without Borders says some Internet users have successfully published messages about the incident in chat rooms by alluding to the shootings without mentioning specifics .
Chinese officials are reporting a new outbreak of bird flu in poultry - this time in northern China .

Roche also announced that it would provide Taiwan with an additional 1.3 million treatments of Tamiflu .
The company said it made the decision after determining that local companies could not produce the drug more rapidly or at a lower cost .
Nearly 70 people have died of bird flu in Asia since 2003 .
The Iraqi prime minister 's office says the journalist who threw his shoes at U.S. President George Bush has apologized .
A spokesman for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said Thursday that reporter Muntazer al-Zaidi wrote a letter in which he asked for Mr. Maliki 's pardon , calling his display an " ugly act . "
Relatives of Zaidi immediately cast doubt that he would write such a letter of his own accord .
The reporter has been in custody since the incident Sunday .
He faces up to 15 years in prison , depending on what charges will be made against him and if he is found guilty .
Thousands of Iraqis have protested in the streets , demanding his release .
Zaidi has become somewhat of a folk hero for his action against Mr. Bush , who spearheaded the invasion of Iraq .

The White House has yet to comment on a published report that the National Security Agency conducted broader surveillance of e-mails and telephone conversations without court orders than the administration has acknowledged .
Current and former government officials told The New York Times the NSA accessed domestic and international communications with help from telecommunication companies .
The newspaper says the companies have been storing information on calling patterns since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States .
NSA officials were reported to have been studying the information in hope of finding terrorists .
The Bush administration has been under increased scrutiny from the public and many lawmakers for authorizing without court orders the surveillance of what the government says are only international calls and e-mails to and from the United States .
Vice President Dick Cheney says the Bush administration has all the legal authority it needs to wiretap phone calls and e-mails between U.S. citizens and persons abroad suspected of links to terrorism .
Cheney was asked on a national U.S. television show PBSNewshour Tuesday if the president would be willing to work with Congress to settle some of the disputes about the legality of the secret surveillance program .
He expressed concern that the legislative process could lead to the disclosure of sensitive operational matters .

Reports say the 31-year-old patient in the town of Shenzhen developed fever and pneumonia-like symptoms June 3 .
Earlier Thursday , the World Health Organization confirmed that a seven-year-old Indonesian girl who died last month was infected with bird flu .
That means 38 people in Indonesia have now died of bird flu .
Avian flu has killed more than 125 people around the world since late 2003 .
Most of the victims have been in Asia .

Despite Mr. Zelaya 's statements , envoys from the two sides say negotiations will continue .
Mr. Micheletti has been under intense international pressure to restore Mr. Zelaya .
The deposed president 's opponents say he was ousted because he was trying to illegally change the constitution to extend his term in office .

By that measure , prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent .
Energy prices soared earlier this year because of hurricane damage .
A separate report says the number of people who lost jobs because of Hurricanes Katrina , Rita , and Wilma now exceeds $ 6,00,000 .

The U.S. government has proposed a new , high-tech passport card for Americans who travel internationally within the Western Hemisphere .
The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security have submitted Tuesday a proposal for public comment .
The plan calls for a card that is small enough to fit into a person 's wallet .
It would meet the same standards as a traditional passport book , but would only be used by U.S. citizens traveling from the U.S. to Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and Bermuda .
The proposed card would use radio frequency identification ( RFID ) that links the card to a government database that contains biographical information and a photograph .
The State Department says the passport card could make frequent travel easier for people who live in border communities .

The three-judge panel made the decision Tuesday , in an effort to speed up the Milosevic trial .
It previously had suggested a division , amid growing concerns about the former Yugoslav president 's poor health , which has repeatedly delayed the proceedings .
The court also adjourned the trial until January 23 , ahead of a planned Christmas break , giving Mr. Milosevic an additional three weeks to rest .
It rejected Mr. Milosevic 's request for extra time to present his defense , and it criticized him for focusing most of his time on Kosovo in efforts to force the court to give him the extension .

Russia 's state-run gas monopoly Gazprom says the deal , announced Thursday , also specifies prices for gas delivered in the first two months of this year .
Additionally , the new agreement streamlines gas trade by eliminating intermediary companies that Ukraine said were complicating gas payment procedures .
Gazprom cut gas deliveries to Ukraine by more than 50 percent earlier this month , because , it said , no payment provisions were in place for gas delivered to Ukraine in January and February .

Ukraine threatened to siphon gas meant for Europe from pipelines that cross Ukraine .
The Israeli military says Israeli and Palestinian officials have agreed to meet for a second time Wednesday to resolve a standoff on handing over security of the West Bank town of Jericho .
Talks earlier Wednesday on transferring control of the towns of Jericho and Tulkarem broke down without an agreement .
Palestinian officials said the biggest obstacle is whether Israel will agree to remove the main checkpoint at the entrance of Jericho .
The Israeli pullback was agreed to at a Palestinian-Israeli summit last month in Egypt , but has been delayed because of a Palestinian suicide bombing 12 days ago in Tel Aviv that killed four people .
The transfer would be the first of several planned Israeli pullouts from five towns in the West Bank , including Qalqilya , Bethlehem and Ramallah .

A pro-Kurdish news agency says Kurdish rebels have extended their unilateral ceasefire with Turkey for two more weeks .
Their original 30-day truce expired on Tuesday .
The notice was published Wednesday by the Mesopotamia news agency , which frequently carries rebel statements .
This ceasefire extension by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party , known as the PKK , appears timed to coincide with the October 3 start of Turkey 's membership talks with the European Union .
The Associated Press quotes rebels who urged the Turkish government to correctly assess the historic opportunity for peace .
Turkey has repeatedly said it will not enter into direct talks with the PKK .
In announcing the ceasefire last month , the PKK said it would not conduct any operations beyond self-defense .
But Western news reports say rebels clashed twice last week with Turkish soldiers in southeastern Turkey .
Five soldiers were reported killed in the fighting .

About 430 chickens died between March and May at a poultry farm in Ibaraki prefecture , north of Tokyo .
The farm keeps 25,000 chickens .
A government laboratory is conducting tests to confirm whether the deaths were caused by the virus .

The U.S. special envoy to Sudan , Andrew Natsios , has warned of what he calls a " poisonous " political atmosphere between Sudan 's government in the north and rebels in the south .
Natsios Saturday said the U.S. is deeply concerned about the health of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 .
He made the comments as he wrapped up a 10-day visit to Sudan .
That agreement ended the two decade-long civil war between the government in Khartoum and southern rebels .
Both sides have been critical of each other over missed deadlines for implementing key parts of the accord .
The agreement makes both sides partners in resolving the conflict in Darfur .
But Natsios said implementation has been made difficult , in part , because both parties are facing one another in elections slated for 2009 .
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it has finished pumping water out of New Orleans , after the southern city flooded as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
A spokeswoman for the Corps made the announcement Tuesday after working for weeks to pump the water out at a rate of about 15 centimeters per day .
The Corps of Engineers is responsible for New Orleans ' levees and flood walls .
Most of the city is below sea level , and some 80 percent of it flooded after Katrina when water overflowed some flood walls and broke through others .
Some neighborhoods were inundated a second time when Rita brought heavy rains last month .
The Corps spokeswoman said the levees will be repaired to a pre-Katrina level of readiness by next June .

Russian President Vladimir Putin says his government will only support proposals on the future of Serbia 's Kosovo province if they are acceptable to both Serbia and ethnic Albanians living in the province .
Mr. Putin spoke Sunday , in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
His comments came as U.N. envoys prepare to give the U.N. Security Council recommendations on the future of the province .
Ethnic Albanians , who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo 's population , are seeking independence - a push strongly opposed by Belgrade .
Negotiators are expected to present a compromise offering some form of provincial autonomy .
As a member of the Security Council , Russia - a historically close ally of Serbia - is likely to play a key role in Kosovo 's future , because it can use its Council veto to block any deal that does not satisfy Belgrade .

Concerns about swine flu have been hurting industries as diverse as airlines and pork production , and boosted demand for the dollar and the yen .
Airlines that were already struggling with a recession that slashed demand must now cope with a sharp fall in travel to Mexico , a popular tourist destination .
Falling demand for jet fuel is putting downward pressure on oil prices .
And pork producers , and the farmers who grow grain to feed pigs , have also seen prices for their commodities drop sharply as some nations banned imports of pork from Mexico and some parts of the United States .
The ban , and the falling prices came even though health experts have said repeatedly that properly cooked pork does not transmit the flu .
Worried traders also sold the Mexican peso and some other currencies , and bought U.S. dollars and Japanese yen for their perceived safety in a crisis .

Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since 1990 and today stands out as a success story among transition economies .
It is the only country in the European Union to maintain positive GDP growth through the 2008 - 2009 economic downturn .
GDP per capita is still much below the EU average , but is similar to that of the three Baltic states .
Since 2004 , EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy .
Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4 % in October 2008 , but climbed back to 11.8 % for the year 2010 , exceeding the EU average by more than 2 % .
Inflation reached a low of about 2.6 % in 2010 due to the global economic slowdown but has since climbed and is expected to remain around 3 % , and close to the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland 's target rate .
Poland 's economic performance could improve over the longer term if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure and its business environment .
An inefficient commercial court system , a rigid labor code , bureaucratic red tape , burdensome tax system , and persistent low-level corruption keep the private sector from performing up to its full potential .
Rising demands to fund health care , education , and the state pension system caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9 % of GDP in 2010 .
The PO/PSL coalition government , which came to power in November 2007 , has planned to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms , increase workforce participation , reduce public sector spending growth , lower taxes , and accelerate privatization .
The government has moved slowly on most major reforms , but has sped up privatization .

Over the past 20 years the government has transformed New Zealand from an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary British market access to a more industrialized , free market economy that can compete globally .
This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector .
Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms , but fell in 2008 - 9 .
Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade , helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers .
Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007 - 8 ; international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the currency and housing market , however , aggravating the current account deficit .
The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008 - 9 .
In line with global peers , the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures .
The economy posted a 1.7 % decline in 2009 , but pulled out of recession late in the year , and achieved 2.1 % growth in 2010 .
Nevertheless , key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand .
The government plans to raise productivity growth and develop infrastructure , while reining in government spending .

A group of climate researchers says there is evidence that global warming is causing the Antarctic ice cap to melt more quickly than it did 10 years ago .
The scientists said Monday they used satellite data to monitor the Antarctic coastline .
They found the ice sheet on the Earth 's southern pole lost 59 percent more ice in 2006 than it did in 1996 .

He said it is a problem that can not be fixed simply with drywall and paint .
Mitchell said voters should hold the Bush administration accountable for those shortfalls because it did not provide adequate funding .
He said Democrats have added $ 3.5 billion for veterans ' care to the president 's budget request for war funding .
Congress has not voted yet to approve this year 's budget .
Former Israeli President Moshe Katsav has been indicted on charges of rape and other sexual offenses .
The indictment filed Thursday in a Tel Aviv court accused Mr. Katsav of raping a woman who once worked for him , in addition to sexual harassment charges involving two other former female employees .
The indictment said the women worked for Mr. Katsav while he was Israel 's Tourism Minister in the 1990s , and president earlier this decade .
Mr. Katsav resigned shortly before his term ended in 2007 at the end of his presidential term , under a plea bargain that would have required him to admit to lesser charges of sexual misconduct .
He withdrew from the agreement last April and so he could stand trial in hopes of clearing his name .
He has vigorously denied the charges facing him .
The NATO-led international force in Afghanistan is preparing to build a helipad near the site of last week 's crash of an Afghan airliner that killed all 104 people onboard .
A spokesman says the aim is to speed up the investigation and the recovery of bodies from the crash site , which is at an altitude of nearly 3,000 meters on a mountain near Kabul .
Bad weather so far has hampered efforts to search for the black box and retrieve bodies from the wreckage .

The French News Agency , AFP , says the United Nations has grounded another Boeing 737 hired from Kam Air .

Another 30 million Americans are expected to travel by car , leading to long traffic jams around major cities .
In Lebanon , hundreds of thousands of Shi'ite Muslims marched through southern Beirut Thursday to commemorate the death of a revered leader and to protest cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad .
The march is an annual event to mark Ashura , when Shi'ites mourn the death of the prophet 's grandson , Imam Hussain , more than 1,300 years ago .
Shi'ite mourners dressed in black chanted slogans of allegiance to the Prophet Muhammad , and carried placards denouncing cartoon depictions of him .
There were no reports of violence .
Less than a week ago , a Beirut protest against publication of the cartoons in Denmark and other European countries turned into a rampage that left the Danish embassy in flames and dozens injured .
President Bush and Jordan 's King Abdullah have called on foreign governments to end the deadly rioting that has spread across the Muslim world after the cartoons .
India has released 24 Pakistani prisoners detained for border violations .
The men , who spent between six months and 15 years in Indian jails for straying into Indian territory , were handed over to Pakistani authorities at the Wagah border crossing Thursday .
The handover comes ahead of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's visit to New Delhi to watch the final cricket match between Indian and Pakistani cricket teams .
The visit is part of efforts to improve relations between the two nuclear neighbors and establish a lasting peace in the region .
India and Pakistan often arrest villagers and fishermen for illegally entering each other 's territory and territorial waters .
During peace talks , which started last year , the two countries agreed to expedite the release of such prisoners .
The U.S. trade deficit surged to an all-time record high of nearly $ 726 billion in 2005 .
That is a nearly 18 percent increase over the previous year and the fourth consecutive year the gap has hit a record .
Friday 's report from the Commerce Department also says the trade deficit with China was the largest with any U.S. trading partner , rising sharply to a record yearly total of nearly $ 202 billion .
The politically sensitive China trade issue has prompted some members of the U.S. Congress to accuse Beijing of keeping the value of its currency artificially low , giving its exports a price advantage on world markets .
Mexican authorities say huge mudslides , flooding and torrential rains from Hurricane Stan 's recent onslaught have killed at least 130 people in Central America and Mexico .
Stan came ashore along Mexico 's Gulf Coast on Tuesday , knocking down trees and ripping the roofs off houses with winds of 130 kilometers per hour .
Rivers also burst their banks in southern Mexico , washing away bridges and ripping apart houses and buildings .
Additionally , Stan has been blamed for at least 50 deaths in both El Salvador and Guatemala , where mudslides buried houses .
Forecasters say the storm is now a tropical depression and dissipating over the mountains of southeastern Mexico , but they warn it is still capable of producing additional heavy rains and flooding .
Police say Ms. Chang , who wrote about the Japanese occupation of China and the history of Chinese immigrants in the United States , was found dead in her car along a road south of San Francisco .
The official cause of death has not been officially determined , but investigators believe the 36-year-old writer died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound .
Ms. Chang 's best-known work was the 1997 bestseller " The Rape of Nanking , " which described the rape , torture and killings of Chinese civilians at the hands of Japanese troops in the 1930s .
Ms. Chang also wrote " The Chinese in America , " which looked at the history of Chinese immigrants and their descendants in the United States .
India 's Health Ministry has cast doubt on a study by an environmental group that showed that soft drinks produced locally by two U.S. giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola contained high levels of pesticides .
A committee appointed by the ministry said the residue data reported by the New Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment , or CSE , failed to prove its claims .
It also said the group 's sampling methods lacked a scientific and statistically valid basis .
The CSE has slammed the committee 's findings , saying it should not rely on data provided by the two companies .
The study by the CSE sparked an uproar and triggered a ban in six Indian states on the sale of beverages locally produced by the two companies .
PepsiCo and Coca-Cola say their soft drinks manufactured in India comply with stringent international and national standards .
U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery , the final resting place of his slain brothers - President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy .

Vote counting in Iraq 's constitutional referendum continued Sunday , with spot checks of preliminary results suggesting the U.S.-backed charter may have passed .
The Associated Press says an early vote count in crucial Diyala province showed 70 percent of voters saying " yes " to the constitution .
And with most ballots counted in Ninevah province , AP reports " yes " votes were outnumbering " no " nearly four to one .
Diyala and Ninevah are two of four key provinces where Sunni Arab opponents were relying on residents to defeat the constitution .

According to the Commerce Department , this is the first sales increase in seven months .
But the economy remains troubled , as a separate Labor Department report showed the number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment rose for the fourth week in a row .
The total is now just over 4.8 million , which is a record-high .
The number of people signing up for unemployment benefits declined slightly - by 8000 to a total of 6,23,000 - last week .
That level is close to a 26-year high .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new treatment for late-stage cervical cancer .
The treatment is a combination of the drugs Hycamtin and Cisplatin , and is approved for women with incurable , recurrent or persistent cancer of the cervix that has spread to other organs .
The combination is the first time a treatment has been recommended for late-stage cervical cancer .
The FDA originally approved Hycamtin in 1996 for treating ovarian cancer and in 1998 for small-cell lung cancer .
FDA officials say the drug therapy is not a cure , but a potentially life-prolonging option for thousands of women .
Earlier this month , the FDA approved the first vaccine to protect women and girls from contracting the disease .
Each year , about 10,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in American women and there are 3,700 related deaths .
Some 3,00,000 women die of the disease each year worldwide .

U.N. Sanctions chief Ellen Loj told reporters Saturday in Monrovia that Liberia has more work to do , but is working diligently to meet the conditions set for the lifting of the trade sanctions .
A ban on Liberian diamonds was imposed in 2001 by the U.N. Security Council after a British investigation found former Liberian President Charles Taylor was trading the diamonds for weapons for rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone .
The timber sanctions were imposed in 2003 when the Security Council said Taylor was using timber proceeds to fund war at home and in Sierra Leone .
Ellen Loj said the Security Council will meet in June to review the sanctions .

Elections officials in Afghanistan have disqualified dozens of candidates from the country 's upcoming parliamentary elections because of alleged links to militias .
A commissioner of the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission , Ahmad Zia Rafat , said Wednesday that 36 names were removed from the list of final candidates .
The ECC said the candidates were given a chance to fight their disqualification , but they failed to prove their eligibility to run in the September election .

Afghan election officials have said they are determined to hold a fair parliamentary election , after fraud allegations marred last year 's presidential vote .
The ECC found there were massive irregularities in those ballots , and threw out a third of the votes cast for President Hamid Karzai .
The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism revenues , which has replaced sugar , the traditional mainstay of the economy until the 1970s .
Following the 2005 harvest , the government closed the sugar industry after decades of losses of 03-Apr % of GDP annually .
To compensate for employment losses , the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy , such as tourism , export-oriented manufacturing , and offshore banking .
More than 2,00,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009 .
Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean , St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand .
The current government is constrained by one of the world 's highest public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185 % of GDP , largely attributable to public enterprise losses .
US Government assistance is the mainstay of this tiny island economy .
The Marshall Islands received more than $ 1 billion in aid from the US from 1986 - 2002 .
Agricultural production , primarily subsistence , is concentrated on small farms ; the most important commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit .
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts , tuna processing , and copra .
The tourist industry , now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10 % of the labor force , remains the best hope for future added income .
The islands have few natural resources , and imports far exceed exports .
Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association , the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) through 2023 , at which time a Trust Fund made up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts .
Government downsizing , drought , a drop in construction , the decline in tourism , and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1 % over the past decade .
Azerbaijan 's high economic growth during 2006 - 8 was attributable to large and growing oil exports , but some non-export sectors also featured double-digit growth , spurred by growth in the construction , banking , and real estate sectors .
In 2009 , economic growth remained above 9 % even as oil prices moderated and growth in the construction sector cooled .
In 2010 , economic growth slowed to 3.7 % , although the impact of the global financial crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region .
The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008 highs , highlighting Azerbaijan 's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy .
Azerbaijan 's oil production increased dramatically in 1997 , when Azerbaijan signed the first production-sharing arrangement ( PSA ) with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company .
Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan 's gas production are underway .
However , Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms .
Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth , particularly in non-energy sectors .
Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan 's economic progress : the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region .
Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance , while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe .
Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices , the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region , and Azerbaijan 's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur employment .
The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of the Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories .
Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492 ; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland .
In 1697 , Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island , which in 1804 became Haiti .
The remainder of the island , by then known as Santo Domingo , sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years ; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844 .
In 1861 , the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire , but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865 .
A legacy of unsettled , mostly non-representative rule followed , capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 - 61 .
Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963 .
In 1965 , the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH .
In 1966 , Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president .
BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996 .
Since then , regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency .
Former President ( 1996 - 2000 ) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term , and was since reelected to a second consecutive term .
Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century , when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy .
In 1870 , the pope 's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed .
Disputes between a series of " prisoner " popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties , which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy .
In 1984 , a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions , including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion .
Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom , international development , the environment , the Middle East , China , the decline of religion in Europe , terrorism , interreligious dialogue and reconciliation , and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization .
About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Catholic faith .
AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for , while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard work .

Zimbabwe 's economy is growing at a brisk pace despite continuing political uncertainty .
Following a decade of contraction , Zimbabwe 's economy recorded real growth of 5.9 % in 2010 .
But the government of Zimbabwe still faces a number of difficult economic problems , including a large external debt burden and insufficient formal employment .
Zimbabwe 's 1998 - 2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy .
The government 's land reform program , characterized by chaos and violence , has badly damaged the commercial farming sector , the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 4,00,000 jobs , turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products .
The EU and the US provide food aid on humanitarian grounds , though on a smaller scale than before .
Until early 2009 , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit , causing hyperinflation .
The power-sharing government formed in February 2009 has led to some economic improvements , including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls .
The economy is registering its first growth in a decade , but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth .

These remote refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single country 's jurisdiction .
They sustain many endemic species including corals , fish , shellfish , marine mammals , seabirds , water birds , land birds , insects , and vegetation not found elsewhere .
Panama 's dollar-based economy rests primarily on a well-developed services sector that accounts for three-quarters of GDP .
Services include operating the Panama Canal , logistics , banking , the Colon Free Zone , insurance , container ports , flagship registry , and tourism .
Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $ 5.3 billion - about 25 % of current GDP .
The expansion project will more than double the Canal 's capacity , enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal .
The United States and China are the top users of the Canal .
Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama City , valued at $ 1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
Panama 's booming transportation and logistics services sectors , along with aggressive infrastructure development projects , will likely lead the economy to continued growth in 2011 .
Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity , as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America .
About 30 % of the population lives in poverty ; however , from 2006 to 2010 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points , while unemployment dropped from 12 % to 6 % of the labor force .

Speculation over the existence of a " southern land " was not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle .
Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands or an area of ocean .
Several exploration " firsts " were achieved in the early 20th century , but generally the area saw little human activity .
Following World War II , however , there was an upsurge in scientific research on the continent .
A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations , camps , and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica .
Seven have made territorial claims , but not all countries recognize these claims .
In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent , an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims ; signed in 1959 , it entered into force in 1961 .
Tourism is the mainstay of the small open Aruban economy , together with offshore banking .

Iran is facing calls to hand over sensitive nuclear documents for analysis , one day after it escaped immediate referral to the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear activities .
At a meeting Friday in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency 's 35-member board , Britain called for Iran to allow the five main nuclear powers to examine what some experts say are designs for making the explosive core of a nuclear warhead .

The spacecraft was moved to a hangar , and the six astronauts flew back to their training base in Houston .
If the National Air and Space Administration is not able to launch Atlantis next week , the mission to the International Space Station likely will be postponed until October .
NASA 's plans call for an 11-day mission to the space station , where astronauts will conduct three spacewalks to attach solar panels .
The panels eventually will generate one quarter of the station 's energy .
Israel has moved a step closer to the creation of a moderate , new government .
An ambitious plan to draw Israel 's final borders by 2010 is topping the agenda .
Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's centrist Kadima Party and the Dovish Labor party have signed a coalition agreement .
It includes a pledge to withdraw from large parts of the West Bank over the next four years .
Under Mr. Olmert 's plan , about 70,000 Jewish settlers would be removed from their homes .
At the same time , Israel would annex big West Bank settlement blocs .
Mr. Olmert says he would prefer to do this as part of an agreement with the Palestinians .
But he believes that is impossible because the Islamic militant group Hamas , which seeks Israel 's destruction , now heads the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Olmert says if there is no Palestinian peace partner , Israel will withdraw unilaterally .
" We will have to act on the basis of a broad national consensus in Israel and work towards fixing of the permanent border lines even without an agreement . "
Former Palestinian legislator Sabri Saddam says expanding settlements and annexing land will only bring more conflict .
" The unilateral withdrawal is not a solution at all but rather a FALSE disengagement , " he said .
" What we 're looking for is a final , just and fair peace . "
In addition to Palestinian opposition , Mr. Olmert faces another obstacle to implementing the pullout plan .
His coalition with Labor does not give him a majority in the 120-member Knesset or parliament .
Therefore , he will have to bring the ultra-Orthodox Shas party into the coalition , and Shas opposes the pullout plan .
Analysts say the government could collapse in two or three years , when the time comes to remove tens of thousands settlers from their homes .
Nepal 's parliament has voted to abolish the country 's centuries-old monarchy and change to a republic .

The Russian justice ministry says it will sell off part of oil giant Yukos in order to cover the company 's outstanding back taxes .
Ministry officials said Tuesday the value of a Yukos subsidiary Yuganskneftegaz has been established so the government can prepare for the sale .
Officials say Yukos has been taking too much time in paying its back taxes .
A Russian court ruled Monday the embattled company must pay nearly all of the $ 1.34 billion in fines connected to its 2001 tax bill .
Yukos is already struggling to pay $ 3.4 billion in taxes and fines for 2000 , and $ 2.7 billion in taxes for 2001 .
Government critics charge the actions against Yukos are in retaliation for support the firm 's former chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky gave to the political opposition .

They called the new filing an effort to extend the inquiry into the case .
Khodorkovsky , the former chief of the Yukos Oil Company , is serving eight years in prison for fraud and tax evasion - charges he says were politically motivated because of his support for opposition politicians .
The former oil executive is being held in the Siberian city of Chita , where authorities have been investigating money laundering and theft charges against him .

The rift within the party that Mr. Advani 's comments provoked was temporarily patched over .

Crude oil prices continued their surge Thursday hitting a new record high of nearly $ 106 a barrel .
Prices for crude for future delivery went as high as $ 105.97 before easing slightly .
The latest record high for oil follows another record low for the dollar compared to the euro .

The price spike is also related to Wednesday 's decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold oil production steady rather than raise output as requested by Washington .
Some oil-importing nations say more oil would help ease prices , but OPEC officials say the markets are well-supplied with crude .

Earlier , U.S. Senator Norm Coleman called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resign , because he was in charge during what the senator called the " most extensive fraud in the history of the U.N. "
Mr. Coleman heads the Senate Government Affairs subcommittee on investigations , which said last month that it had uncovered evidence of widespread irregularities in the oil-for-food program .
The United Nations is also investigating the charges .

Officials say the store was evacuated and the police found the explosives in a bathroom .
Alliot-Marie said the explosives appeared relatively old and no detonators were attached .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana has held out prospects of closer ties with Belarus following last year 's release of a number of leading opposition activists .
Solana spoke in Minsk after what he called constructive talks with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko .
The Belarusian leader , for his part , called for direct contact between the sides without any intervention by mediators .
In December , the European Union unveiled a plan for building ties with Belarus and five other former Soviet republics .
The plan will provide increased cooperation and aid , but not offer EU membership .
The union earlier lifted sanctions on Mr. Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials following the release of the detainees .
EU authorities imposed the measures in 2006 , following presidential elections that Western monitors said were rigged .
While in Minsk , Solana also met with Belarusian opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich and other activists .
Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell says President Bush was right in authorizing a domestic spying program .
In an interview broadcast Sunday on U.S. television , on ABC 's This Week program , Mr. Powell says there was " absolutely nothing wrong " with the president 's actions , because he was trying to protect the nation in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Mr. Powell acknowledges that the administration could have secured warrants from a secret federal court that approves wiretapping and other forms of eavesdropping .
He also says Congress will have to determine whether it gave Mr. Bush unlimited authority to conduct the domestic spying program without the need to go through legal channels .
But Mr. Powell says the eavesdropping program should continue .
A public-opinion survey immediately after President Bush 's State of the Union address indicates Americans reacted positively to his message .

Another 27 percent described their feelings as " somewhat favorable , " and 23 percent of those surveyed reacted negatively to the president 's remarks .
The network says its polling organization interviewed 464 people .
Because the survey involved only people who watched the speech on television , CNN says the comments include more favorable opinions than a TRUE random sampling might indicate .
According to CNN , the poll had a five-percent margin of possible error .
Forty~three percent of those who took part said they were Republicans , 23 percent said they were Democrats and 34 percent described themselves as independents .
Iraqi election officials say they have finished a preliminary vote count following Sunday 's election and are dispatching returns to Baghdad .

Britain has threatened to seek new international sanctions against Sudan , Sudanese rebels and people seen as blocking peace in the war-torn Darfur region .
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw issued the warning Tuesday at the Darfur peace talks in Abuja , Nigeria .
Those talks are in their seventh round .
Straw accused both rebel and government forces of breaking the cease-fire in Darfur , and he said world leaders have doubts either side is serious about reaching a peace deal .

A new audiotape attributed to Osama bin Laden is calling on Muslims to launch a jihad , or holy war , to stop Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip .
The tape was posted Wednesday on Islamist Web sites where al-Qaida usually issues its messages .
The authenticity of the tape could not be immediately verified .
A White House spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , said the tape appears to show bin Laden 's isolation and his efforts to stay relevant " at a time when al-Qaida 's ideology , mission and agenda are being questioned and challenged throughout the world . "
The spokesman said the tape also looks like a bid to raise money in what he called al-Qaida 's ongoing propaganda campaign .

The Peace Now report says Israeli authorities have planned 73,000 new Jewish housing units in the occupied Palestinian territory .
The report released Monday also says authorities have already approved about 15,000 of the units .
Peace Now cautions that a large expansion could destroy chances for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
The U.S. supports a two-state solution .
Israel 's Housing Ministry says the new plans for the West Bank only refer to potential construction and would need to be approved by government bodies .
Benjamin Netanyahu , who is trying to form a coalition government , has said his government would expand existing settlements to accommodate for " natural growth " of Israel 's populations .

Port officials are appealing to truckers across the United States to come to New Orleans and help move cargo in and out of the port and help rebuild the city 's economy .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , IAEA , continues closed-door meetings in Vienna Friday on the nuclear activities of Iran and South Korea .
Iran has promised the European Union that it will freeze all activities linked to uranium enrichment , which can produce both nuclear fuel and material for atomic weapons .
But Iran continues to demand that it be allowed to operate 20 centrifuges , although the EU insists all enrichment activity be suspended .
The IAEA will decide whether Iran should be referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions if it was covertly trying to produce nuclear weapons .

No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts .
President Bush called on the United States to diversify its sources of energy during his annual State of the Union address .
Mr. Bush said dependence on foreign sources of oil leaves America more vulnerable to hostile regimes and terrorism .
The president called for reducing gasoline usage in the U.S. by 20 percent over the next decade .
He said the goal can be met by increasing the supply of renewable and alternative fuels and reforming fuel economy standards for cars .
Mr. Bush also called for greater use of clean coal technology , solar and wind energy , and nuclear power as alternatives to oil .
He called for research on hybrid automobiles , and investing in new methods of producing ethanol .

The U.S. military says it is searching with all available assets for a U.S. reconnaissance team that disappeared in Afghanistan Tuesday .
The team vanished just before a helicopter coming to help it was shot down in Afghanistan 's mountainous Kunar province bordering Pakistan , with the loss of all 16 Special Forces soldiers aboard .
Military spokesman Colonel Jim Yonts says U.S. forces have been searching for the team since Tuesday 's crash .
He says he has no reason to believe any of its members have been killed or captured .
He said he could neither confirm nor deny a Taleban claim that the insurgents killed seven U.S. soldiers before the helicopter went down .
The crash was the second loss of a U.S. Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan within three months , and came amid a surge in guerrilla activity aimed at derailing the September parliamentary polls .
The southeastern U.S. state of Georgia votes to choose a senator in a runoff election Tuesday , that will help determine whether the Democratic Party can get strong control of the U.S. Senate .
Incumbent Saxby Chambliss - a Republican - is favored to win , which would thwart the Democrats ' ambition to control 60 of the 100 Senate seats .
Sixty seats would create what has been called a " super-majority , " giving Democrats the ability to overcome Republican attempts to filibuster , or block legislation from coming to a vote in the upper house of Congress .
Democrats already control 58 seats in the incoming Senate , with a recount in a very tight race in Minnesota yet to be decided .
Chambliss is facing Democrat Jim Martin in today 's runoff , after each fell short in November of the majority required to win outright in Georgia .

Turkey is required to sign the agreement as a condition for the talks to start .
An EU commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy said Tuesday that Ankara 's signing of the protocol does not amount to Turkish recognition of the Greek Cypriot government .
Turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot part of Cyprus .
The Greek Cypriots joined the European Union last May .

The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in 1960 as the Mali Federation .
When Senegal withdrew after only a few months , what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed Mali .
Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling Mali 's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the continent .
President Alpha KONARE won Mali 's first democratic presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997 .
In keeping with Mali 's two-term constitutional limit , KONARE stepped down in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE , who was subsequently elected to a second term in 2007 .
The elections were widely judged to be free and fair .
Malta produces only about 20 % of its food needs , has limited fresh water supplies , and has few domestic energy sources .
Malta 's geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for illegal immigration , which has strained Malta 's political and economic resources .
Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008 .
Malta 's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in 2008 - 9 it escaped significant damage from the international financial crisis , largely because the sector is centered on the indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged .
Locally , the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent risk-management practices .
The global economic downturn and high electricity and water prices hurt Malta 's real economy , which is dependent on foreign trade , manufacturing - especially electronics and pharmaceuticals - and tourism , but growth bounced back as the global economy recovered in 2010 .
Following a 1.2 % contraction in 2009 , GDP grew 2 % in 2010 .
In early 2011 , the EU ended excessive deficit procedures against Malta , after Malta had taken measures to correct an excessive deficit in 2010 and appeared likely to reach its deficit target of 2.8 % of GDP in 2011 .
The population of the Faroe Islands is largely descended from Viking settlers who arrived in the 9th century .
The islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century .
A high degree of self government was granted the Faroese in 1948 , who have autonomy over most internal affairs while Denmark is responsible for justice , defense , and foreign affairs .
The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union .
In 788 , about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa , successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco .
In the 16th century , the Sa'adi monarchy , particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR ( 1578 - 1603 ) , repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age .
The Alaouite dynasty , to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs , established a sultanate in Morocco beginning in the 17th century .
In 1860 , Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco 's sovereignty steadily erode ; in 1912 , the French imposed a protectorate over the country .
A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956 .
The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year .
Sultan MOHAMMED V , the current monarch 's grandfather , organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king .
Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s , but final resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved .
Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature , which first met in 1997 .
Under King MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human rights have improved .
Morocco enjoys a moderately free press , but the government occasionally takes action against journalists who report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo : the monarchy , Islam , and the status of Western Sahara .
Despite the continuing reforms , ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch .
Influenced by protests elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa , thousands of Moroccans in February and March 2011 rallied in Rabat and several other major cities to demand constitutional reform and more democracy and to protest government corruption and high food prices .
Police response to most of the protests was subdued compared to the violence elsewhere in the region .
In early March , King MOHAMMED VI agreed to establish a commission to reform the country 's constitution ; a popular referendum held in early July 2011 overwhelmingly approved the new constitution .
Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan African nations , but because of high income inequality , a large proportion of the population remains poor .
Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s .
The oil sector now accounts for more than 50 % of GDP although the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production .
Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil , timber , and manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction of 1.4 % in 2009 .
Despite the abundance of natural wealth , poor fiscal management hobbles the economy .
In 1997 , an IMF mission to Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items , overborrowing from the central bank , and slipping on its schedule for privatization and administrative reform .
The rebound of oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth , but drops in production have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains .
Gabon signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007 , and later that year issued a $ 1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a sizable portion of its Paris Club debt .
A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden : among them was his favourite Ass , that was always well fed and often carried his master .
With the Farmer came his Lapdog , who danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be .
The Farmer felt in his pocket , gave the Lapdog some dainty food , and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants .
The Lapdog jumped into his master 's lap , and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears .
The Ass , seeing this , broke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of the Lapdog .
The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter , so the Ass went up to him , and putting his feet upon the Farmer 's shoulder attempted to climb into his lap .
The Farmer 's servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught the Ass that
Clumsy jesting is no joke .

Then the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves .

The British government has announced plans for new laws on the detention of terrorist suspects , after three men failed to report to police Tuesday as required under official monitoring orders .
Home Secretary John Reid , in a statement to parliament , said the monitoring orders were imposed on the three men because it was believed they wanted to travel abroad for terrorist-related activities .

Some analysts say the government may not want Goldman Sachs to repay its loan so soon , because it could pressure other banks to settle their debt before they are financially stable .

Settled by Norwegian and Celtic ( Scottish and Irish ) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D. , Iceland boasts the world 's oldest functioning legislative assembly , the Althing , established in 930 .
Independent for over 300 years , Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark .
Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine .
Over the next quarter century , 20 % of the island 's population emigrated , mostly to Canada and the US .
Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944 .
The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry .
The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994 , but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008 .
Literacy , longevity , and social cohesion are first rate by world standards .
The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves .
In 1932 , French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island ; maintenance was continued by its successor , Vietnam .
China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974 , when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands .
China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor .
The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam .
Two British attempts at establishing the island as a penal colony ( 1788 - 1814 and 1825 - 55 ) were ultimately abandoned .
In 1856 , the island was resettled by Pitcairn Islanders , descendants of the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions .
The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial relations , moderate unemployment and inflation , a sizable current account surplus , and an important role as a European transportation hub .
Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing , chemicals , petroleum refining , and electrical machinery .
A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 % of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports .
The Netherlands , along with 11 of its EU partners , began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002 .
The country has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the US .
After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth , the Netherlands ' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic crisis .
Dutch GDP contracted 3.9 % in 2009 , while exports declined nearly 25 % due to a sharp contraction in world demand .
The Dutch financial sector has also suffered , due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities .
In response to turmoil in financial markets , the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third , to prevent further systemic risk .
The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs , offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers , and expanding export credit facilities .
The stimulus programs and bank bailouts , however , resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 % of GDP in 2009 and 5.3 % in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 % of GDP in 2008 .
With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption , the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery .
Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on dwindling oil resources .
Because of declining reserves , Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification , industrialization , and privatization , with the objective of reducing the oil sector 's contribution to GDP to 9 % by 2020 .
Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government 's diversification strategy .
By using enhanced oil recovery techniques , Oman succeeded in increasing oil production , giving the country more time to diversify , and the increase in global oil prices throughout 2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest in non-oil sectors .

Guenael Rodier said Tuesday there is no evidence the disease is being spread by human-to-human contact .
He said the outbreak appears to be similar to what has happened in Asia -- small family groups coming into contact with infected birds .

A group of U.S. astronomers say there is a chance an asteroid could hit the planet Mars by the end of next month .
Stargazers in Arizona discovered a 50-meter wide asteroid in November that was designated " 2007 WD5 . "
Astronomers at the U.S. space agency NASA 's Near-Earth Object Office are tracking the object and say it may pass within 48,000 kilometers of Mars by January 30 .
The astronomers say there is a one-in-75 chance the asteroid will strike the planet on that day .
The asteroid is compared to a similar object that struck Siberia in 1908 with the energy of a three-megaton bomb and destroyed tens of millions of trees .
NASA officials say if the asteroid does hit Mars , it will do so near the location of its Opportunity rover , which has been exploring the Martian surface for three years .

NASA scientists say they are " flabbergasted " to find that soil on Mars appears rich enough to grow such Earth-bound plants as asparagus .
U.S. space researchers revealed the results of their first " wet " chemical analysis of Martian dirt Thursday and said it is not as acidic as expected , appearing to have the requirements and nutrients to support life .
The sample was taken two weeks ago by the Mars Lander Phoenix , then heated to over 538 degrees Celsius .
At that point , the sample released water vapor .
The scientists said the the dirt is similar to that in a typical backyard .
As exciting as the scientists find the discovery , they point out that they can study only the chemistry of Mars , not whether anything has ever lived there .

Part of Romania during the interwar period , Moldova was incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II .
Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991 , Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population , mostly Ukrainians and Russians , who have proclaimed a " Transnistria " republic .
One of the poorest nations in Europe , Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a Communist , Vladimir VORONIN , as its president in 2001 .
VORONIN served as Moldova 's president until he resigned in September 2009 , following the opposition 's gain of a narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist Party 's ( PCRM ) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of parliamentary votes required to elect a president .
Moldova 's four opposition parties formed a new coalition , the Alliance for European Integration ( AIE ) , which acted as Moldova 's governing coalition until December 2010 .
Moldova experienced significant political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010 , holding three general elections ( in April 2009 , July 2009 , and November 2010 ) and four presidential ballots in parliament , all of which failed to secure a president .
Following the November 2010 parliamentary elections , a reconstituted AIE-coalition of three parties formed a government , but remains two votes short of the three-fifths majority required to elect a president .

The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia .
The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D . and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s .
Domination by Persians , Arabs , and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age ( 11th - 13th centuries ) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236 .
Subsequently , the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region .
Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century .
Independent for three years ( 1918 - 1921 ) following the Russian revolution , it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 .
An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE , president since 1995 .

Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence , but this progress has been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
After a series of Russian and separatist provocations in summer 2008 , Georgian military action in South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response that not only occupied the breakaway areas , but large portions of Georgia proper as well .
Russian troops pulled back from most occupied Georgian territory , but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
This action was strongly condemned by most of the world 's nations and international organizations .
A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ( ACC ) , an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica , plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation .
The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons , but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region .
The Convergence concentrates nutrients , which promotes marine plant life , and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life .
In the spring of 2000 , the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean , Indian Ocean , and Pacific Ocean .
The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude , which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence .
As such , the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean , Atlantic Ocean , and Indian Ocean , but larger than the Arctic Ocean ) .
It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world 's primary oceans by the US Government .
Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for Spain , it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and set about exploiting its salt deposits .
The Spanish retook the island in 1633 , but continued to be harassed by the Dutch .
The Spanish finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the French and Dutch , who divided it amongst themselves in 1648 .
The establishment of cotton , tobacco , and sugar plantations dramatically expanded slavery on the island in the 18th and 19th centuries ; the practice was not abolished in the Dutch half until 1863 .
The island 's economy declined until 1939 when it became a free port ; the tourism industry was dramatically expanded beginning in the 1950s .
In 1954 , Sint Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the Netherlands Antilles .
In a 2000 referendum , the citizens of Sint Maarten voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
The change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles .
AN ASS , having put on the Lion 's skin , roamed about in the forest and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his wanderings .

A CROW having stolen a bit of meat , perched in a tree and held it in her beak .
A Fox , seeing this , longed to possess the meat himself , and by a wily stratagem succeeded .
" How handsome is the Crow , " he exclaimed , in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion !

This he said deceitfully ; but the Crow , anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice , set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh .
The Fox quickly picked it up , and thus addressed the Crow : " My good Crow , your voice is right enough , but your wit is wanting . "
A MAN had two dogs : a Hound , trained to assist him in his sports , and a Housedog , taught to watch the house .
When he returned home after a good day 's sport , he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil .
The Hound , feeling much aggrieved at this , reproached his companion , saying , " It is very hard to have all this labor , while you , who do not assist in the chase , luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions . "
The Housedog replied , " Do not blame me , my friend , but find fault with the master , who has not taught me to labor , but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others . "
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has criticized the outcry about the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to die by stoning .
The United States , European Union and international human rights groups have all urged Tehran to stay the execution of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani .

The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a limited agricultural base , and relies in part on remittances from workers overseas and tourist receipts .
About three-quarters of the population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood .
Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts , fish , and hides .
The Gambia 's natural beauty and proximity to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West Africa , boosted by government and private sector investments in eco-tourism and upscale facilities .
In the past few years , The Gambia 's re-export trade - traditionally a major segment of economic activity - has declined , but its banking sector has grown rapidly .
